# Any Mail Merge
Generates different variations of the same file from a scv.
This script can be used to mail merge any text files. I mean all text files, including:

- markdown (.md)

- scalable vector graphics (.svg)

- etc.

All you need to do is to execute the script`amm.py` with the following parameters:

```bash
python3 amm.py source.csv template.txt
```

**⚠ Make sure the name of the variable in the template file is the same as the name of the field in the csv. ⚠**
